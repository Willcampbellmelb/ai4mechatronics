## Project 1 
# Basic Task(3%)

# Tasks
* Train fully connected OR convolutional nn classifier on the training set and test it on the test MINST set acc(.88~.95)
* Save trained model to ckpt files and model summ to event files
* Visualize randomly sampled 400 images using built in
		* t-SNE and PCA tools in TensoarBoard
* Collect the mode RUNITME STATISTICS durring training process for 5 iterations and visualize them in chrome://tracing
* Basic task is titled cnn.ipynb in the main project folder, it will generate all but visualization files. 

## Instructions for navigation and running models.
* Each section (visualization, train and test, profile and additional task) are found in sub dirctories
* Monitoring files ofr tensor board can be generated and run by the notebook and have been submited with submision.

# Bonus(2%)
* Compared 2 gradient methods to initial CNN
