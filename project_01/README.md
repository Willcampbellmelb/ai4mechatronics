## Project 1 
#Basic Task(3%)
--
-> Train fully connected OR convolutional nn classifier on the training set and test it on the test MINST set acc(.88~.95)
-> Save trained model to ckpt files and model summ to event files
-> visualize randomly sampled 400 images using built in
		-> t-SNE and PCA tools in TensoarBoard
-> Collect the mode RUNITME STATISTICS durring training process for 5 iterations and visualize them in chrome://tracing

#Bonus(2%)
--
-> Compare 2 or 3 gradient methods or learning rate schedules
-> Do ablation study on 2 or 3 regularization methods.
-> Compare 2 or 3 network architecturtes.
