## CNN to explore tensorflow functionality.
Train and test a classification model using a CNN on training and test set. 

* Keras library used for simplicity and tighter code library
* Therfore Weighted checkpoints uploaded as .hdf5 files
* If needed .hdf5 files can be converted for tensorflow using [Keras to Tensor Flow functuon](https://github.com/amir-abdi/keras_to_tensorflow)
